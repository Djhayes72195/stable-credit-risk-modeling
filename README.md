The purpose of this project is to develop a model which predicts the probability of default on a home loan.

A key element of this project is a focus on model stability. In the real world,
client behaviors change constantly. As such, model performance is likely to degrade over
time. Once the performance of a model has significantly degraded, it becomes necessary
to recalibrate, which is time-consuming and expensive. A model which maintains consistent
performance over time is ideal.
